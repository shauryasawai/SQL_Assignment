# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

Welcome to my first SQL project! In this project, I've tackled a series of questions based on a Music Playlist database. This database contains information about songs, artists, albums, and playlists, and I've used SQL to extract, analyze, and manipulate this data to answer various queries.

## Database and Tools
* Postgre SQL
* PgAdmin4
